<h1 align="center"> OpenAI is not Open </h1>
<br/>
To get this out of the way, I love "Open"AI. They make absolutely incredible tools and actually release them to be used (unlike Google and Facebook).

<br/>

However, I am beyond tired of conversations like this:

With the new *OpenAI is not Open* extension, every instance of OpenAI will be replaced by "Open"AI. Hopefully if enough people install this extension, we will stop having this boring repetitive conversation. It even works on their own website:

So just add this extension to Firefox today!

### Firefox only. If someone wants to bring this to Chromium, go for it.
